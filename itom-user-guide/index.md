# Introduction to ITOM 
Hornbill's IT Operations Management (ITOM) includes administrative processes and support for software and hardware that allow you to execute routine tasks to support and control your IT services and IT infrastructure. Based around several key components hosted within the Hornbill cloud and an on-premise service running behind the corporate firewall. These components allow the ability to discover devices across the network infrastructure, use various techniques, and initiate IT automation and Orchestrations.

Packages are the core components used to provide IT Automation and are the building blocks used within an Orchestration using ITOM Runbooks or Hornbill Workflows. They are published within the ITOM Package Library, produced and maintained by Hornbill, with packages being regularly developed. It is also possible to create custom packages, where required the expertise is available in-house, using the ITOM Package creator.

An Automation can be created directly within the Job queue on an ad-hoc basis or scheduled along with Runbooks using the Job Scheduler and easily used within other Hornbill applications via Workflows and AutoTasks. Developers can use Hornbill's XMLMC API to trigger an Automation or Runbook process, allowing integration of external applications and systems.
